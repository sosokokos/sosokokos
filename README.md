ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel Surina, a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University, who is deeply passionate about solving complex challenges across various domains.
  
ðŸ‘€ Passionate about anything tech related, my academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, UI/UX Design, and more. I've led projects like a Natural Language Processing application integrating LangChain API and Pinecone, and a Python application interfacing with SQL databases. Leadership roles in the IT Squad and SFU Ski and Snowboarding Club have honed my management skills. 

ðŸŒ± I'm skilled in C++, Python, Java, SQL, and familiar with tools like GitHub, VSCode, Xcode and Android Studio. Let's connect and explore the future of technology together!
